This year, the goal of the challenge was to determine the presence of a specific genetic sequence, MGMT promoter methylation, in a tumor, using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image). This gene sequence plays a strong role in the outcome of chemotherapy in patients with brain tumor, but it can only be analysed using DNA extraction, which takes a lot of time.</description></item></channel></rss>
