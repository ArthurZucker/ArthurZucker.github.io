## Introduction 

### What is RL? When to use it? Why RL? 

RL, a short for Reinforcement Learning, is a subclass of machine learning, which focuses on building a model able to learn from his action in an environnement. It builds its knowledge threw *reinforcing* what it knows, threw trial and error. 

RL has a lot of applications, ranging from finance (where the goal can be to optimize sales live, and the model learns to buy/sell) to robotics, game solving or exploration. Any task which requires an action to be taken to maximize a utility function can use RL models. One of the most successful usage of RL is **[alphago]()**, a model which taught himself how to play *Go*, and beat the world champion. *Go* was considered to be the last barrier, one of the most complex game, given the huge amount of configurations : more than **??** which is more atom than the universe contains. 

Let's try to give a proper definition to RL. 
In any RL model, there is :
 - an RL agent
 - an Environment, deterministic or stochastic
 - actions
 - rewards, sometimes long-term like in go, or short term in portfolio management. But you can have intermediate rewards/signals. You need the knowledge to do that, but might not be possible. Long time effects/certain configurations are optimal?. The function is still free to be designed.  
 - states, sometimes unknown, like the stock prices that are unpredictable. Can only see a realization. Lots of uncertainty. 

Goal is to maximize the reward. Sometimes you don't know the Environment / reward and can only observe! Connected to adaptive control theory, act by looking at the observations you get through the interactions with the systems. 

**Framework for learning by interaction under uncertainty**, agent takes action, receives reward, and the environment evolves to the next state.

## 1. Markov Decision Process

A RL problem is modelled using *Markov processes*. 

### The Reinforcement Learning Model 

(insert image provide)

It can be described using simple keywords : 
* Environment, which defines where the Agent evolves 
* Agent, is the ??? learning 
* Actions and their associated rewards
* States, which allow the definition of the system 

Lets follow along a simple example throughout this course, in order to better understand each notions. 
TODO, define the 4 notions above in the case of a simple atari game.

### The RL interactions 

The classic RL interaction is as follows: 

We have a discrete decision time $t$ (which would be for example seconds), and at each timestamp : 

1. The *agent* selects an *action* $a_t$, based on $s_t$ the current *state* of the system. 
2. The *agent* gets his *reward* $r_t$
3. The *Environment* moves to a new state $s_{t+1}$

### Markov chains

Markov Chains are the building blocks of RL. A Markov Chain is a stochastic  (which means that it includes randomness )  model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event[^1]. In order to create a model, we need to introduce mathematical definitions. 

[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain

<g>Definition :</g> Given $S$, a state space and a bounded  compact subset of the Euclidean space, the discrete time dynamic system $(s_t)_{t\in \mathbb{N}}$  is a markov Chain **if it satisfies** the <r>Markov property</r>: 

$$ \mathbb{P}\left(s_{t+1}=s \mid s_{t}, s_{t-1}, \ldots, s_{0}\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(s_{t+1}=s \mid s_{t}\right)$$

This means that given an initial state $s_0$, the markov chain is defined by the transition probability :  $p\left(s^{\prime} \mid s\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(s_{t+1}=s^{\prime} \mid s_{t}=s\right)$. 


<o> Intuition:</o> a markov chain only needs an initial state, and a transition probability to figure out any later state, it is defined by the transition probability. 

@TODO add 4 states markov chain example with attari like states

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)

A Markov Decision Process is a tool, to model decision making when outcomes can be random. 

<g>Definition :</g> a Markov Decision Process is defined as a tuple <b>$M=(S,A,p,r)$</b> with 

* $S$ the (finite) State space
* $A$ the (finite) Action space
* $p(s'|s,a)$ the transition probability, such that $\mathbb{P}\left(s_{t+1}=s' \mid s_{t}=s,a_t=a\right)$
* $r(s,a,s')$ is the reward of the transition from $s$ to $s'$ taking the action $a$. The reward can be stochastic, but we can express its distribution, $v$ for $s,a$ as $v(s,a)$. Thus the reward can be writtent as : $r(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{R\sim v(s,a)}[R]$. 

#### Assumptions

 <b>Markov assumptions</b> : the current state $s$ and the action $a$ are a sufficient statistic for the next state $s'$. This means that "no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter"[^2]. Our statistic provides as much information as possible. 

[^2]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficient_statistic#cite_note-Fisher1922-1

 <b>Time assumption</b> : time is discrete, not continuous. At each step, $t\rightarrow t+1$.

 <b>Reward assumption</b> : the reward is uniquely defined by a transition from a state $s$, to $s'$ and an action $a$. 

 <b>Stationary assumption</b> : transition and reward don't change with time. Otherwise, it's non-stationary. 

## 2. Policy 

<g>Definition : </g>a decision rule $d$, which chooses an action from the state $S$ of the system can be : 

- Deterministic, given the same set of state $S$, the action $a\in A$ will be chosen
- Stochastic, a probability distribution over the actions determines $a$.  
- History-dependant, and is thus  
- Markov

<g>Definition</g> : A policy is a sequence of decision rules, it can be :

- Non-stationary, then $\pi = (d_0,d_1,...)$ 
- stationary, then $\pi = (d,d,...)$

At each round t, an agent following the policy $\pi$ selects the actions $a_t \sim d_t(s_t)$ .

### Markov chain of a policy 

A stationary policy defines a Markov chain on a random process! Why?  Well the transition probability of a random process $(s_t)_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ with regards to a stationary policy $\pi$ is the following : 

$$ P^\pi (s'\mid s) = \mathbb{P}(s_{t+1}=s' \mid s_t = s, \pi) $$  

Every actions in $A$ (even if it does not take the state from $s$ to $s'$) has to be taken into account. Thus we deduce that $$ p^\pi (s'\mid s) = \sum_{a\in A} \pi(s,a)p(s'\mid s,a) $$

## 3. Optimality Principle

This part answers the question of how good is a policy, and how do we measure this.

### State value function 

The state value function allows us to determine the effectiveness of a policy. Various definitions can be used depending on the problem at hand. For the following definitions, let $\pi = (d_1, d_2, ...,)$ be a deterministic policy. 

- The <g>Finite time horizon T</g> policy, sets a deadline $T$, at which the sum of the rewards up to $T$ will be computed. The value function can be expressed as : 

$$ V^\pi(t,s) = \mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{\tau = t}^{T-1} r(s_\tau,d_\tau(h_\tau)) + R(s_T) \mid s_t = s; \pi = (d_1, d_2, ...,) \right ]$$

Here, where $R$ is a value function for the final state. This mathematical formula simply expresses the fact that the state value function $V$, for a certain policy $\pi$, a time $t$ which will be the the "beginning" of the computation, and a state $s$ such that at time $t$, the system is in the state $s$, is equal to the Expectation of the sum of the rewards obtained taking actions according ot the policy, and receiving the corresponding rewards. We have to take into account the Expectation because the decision process can be stochastic, and thus the Expectation gives the equivalent of the mean rewards in a stochastic model. \
:memo: It is usually used when there is a deadline to meet.

## Following part belongs to what I wrote during the class

### Optimality policy 

How good is the policy? 
**Sate Value Function**, focus on the sum of rewards. Finite horizon T, after T the game is done. Depends on the time in that state. Expectation under the policy of the sum reward! 

Popular is: infinite horison with discount, rewards closer in time receive a hogher importance! How far-sighted is my agent? Max immediate reward or not

Stochastic shortest path, agent will reach a termination state. *Used when ther is a specific goal condition*. p28 h_t solely dependent ? 

 $a_t \approx d_t(s_t)$ at drawn form decision rule $d_t$ and state $s_t$

Infinite Horizon with average reward. Consider the average reward, most complicated setting, so will not cover much bout it. Expectation, over all the randomicity involved in the computation. 

Optimal policy maximises the value function, over the set of state over all the policies. V* is the optimal policy. Value function dpends on the state, it is not a well defined optimisation function, but there is always one maximising. 


# Optimisation problem  

## Solving Infinite horizon discounted MDP
Solving **exactly** an MDP : dynamic programming, know both P and R. MDP is stable, finite state and actions. Bellman equations? 
p5 most generic definition. Find the max in the policy state. How to simplify the problem? 


proba of being in a state S at time t and taking action. Proba based on the time, sum over time for it to be independent. Discounted sum of the proba over time. 

#### History based :point_right: Markov Policies? 
**theorem** : 
for any history based policy, there exists a markov policy. They are as expressive as history-based policies. 
Why? the value function is equivalent to product between reward and occupancy measure! All the history dep  has the same occupancy measure, can consider the same markov. Now can focus on the single state I am in, not all the history. Important theorem.  Stationary policies can generate any value functions 


#### Non stationary :point_right: stationary 
Can show the same think with the occupancy measure. Both are as expressive. We now have fixed decision rule + markov. 
Proofs can be found, should I try to give an intuitive proof? By analysing it. 
But still have al ot of policies to check. 

Problems: policy evaluation and control? 

### Policy evaluation :point_right: compute value function on the policy 
**Bellman equation**, the value functions satisfies it. reward you get in state s plus the expectation based on the transition function. Fixed point equation. **CORE OF Dynammic approach**. Allow us to solve an RL problem. Proof skipped, I will try to explain it. 

Usding the equation: S variables, linear constraints with S equations and variables. => matrix notation. Fundamental matrix $(I-\gamma P ^\pi )^-1 \times r^\pi$ => solve it by inverting the SxS matrix. 

### Control? MDP given, find the optimal policy 
policy evaluation is used for that! => to find the optimal policy. 
Bellman equation again, principle of optimality [1957]. P optimal if the next states are also optimal. (hints on the fixed point equation). 

Now deterministic, always there in MDP! 

Given the equations, the optimal policy maximizes the value function.  Might be multiple action, pic any. 

2 important incomes : bellman inequality, fixed point; optimal V* => get policy by being greedy. 
No linear system, so can't solve it linearly. Complication starts here. Iterative and all. The control problem is what we need to solve!

Assumption? we know P and R, and that the MDP is stable. 

#### Bellman operator
associated to the bellman equation. 
Can right now using the operator : $V= T^\pi V$ same for optimal

**Properies** :
- Monotonicy 
- Additivity
- contraction in Linf norm. Application of the operator, makes the results closer than were we started. Its converging toward something. 
- fixed point : exists a unique fixed point $V^\pi$ and $V^*$

Results from Banach fixed point theorem. The iterative operator will converge! Key property! To define a solution. 

> Summarize : 
Few concepts to remind : 
- transition proba
- reward function 
- policy 
define a MDP 
Optimality? aime ot solve the cumulative reward = V or value function 
Can restrict the set of policies, stationary, markov and deterministic, which simplifies.
Bellman operators are fundamental and relates the definition in a single step. Can right as a single step, value is reward plus expectation in the next step. 
Nice properties, guarantees that we can run it iteratively. 

page 30 : pi * : a policie, the optimal is non zero only for the actions that are optimal. Select any deterministic policy and selecting it. pi^* (s) belongs to the argmax. => its deterministic and can thus pic any actions that belong to the argmax. Greedy! with respect to the bellman operators. 
p30 strictly positive

**State action** vs **state value** function. 

Another element? State action greedy function? utility vs utility and action. 
Sum of rewards discounted, forcing initial action to be a, then follow the policy for all the next states etc. Q function?! Optimal policy is greedy with respect to Q. What is greedy?  p41, V*(s'). 
Start from Q* is simply pi(s) \in max Q*(s,a))
They also satisfy the bellman equation.
