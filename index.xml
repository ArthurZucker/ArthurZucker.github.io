Introduction What is RL? When to use it? Why RL? RL, a short for Reinforcement Learning, is a subclass of machine learning, which focuses on building a model able to learn from his action in an environnement.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Table Structure Recogniton</title><link>https://arthurzucker.github.io/automatic-table-structure-recogniton/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 10:12:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://arthurzucker.github.io/automatic-table-structure-recogniton/</guid><description>During my 3rd yearh internship at Chainos Solution, my collegue Younes Belkda and I developped an automatic Table structure recogniton based on Artificial intelligence. We called it CLUSTI!
Problem statement Some organizations still use huge amounts of scanned tables / invoices. Rather than manually typing the contents of the tables into an excel file, one can think of using Deep Learning to tackle this problem. Once you identify the distinguishable cells on the tables, we can pass an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to each cell to read its contents and convert it to an excel file for example.</description></item><item><title>BRATS2021</title><link>https://arthurzucker.github.io/posts/ai-projects/brats/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://arthurzucker.github.io/posts/ai-projects/brats/</guid><description>Recently I am working on BRATS2021 with my long time collegue Younes Belkada.
